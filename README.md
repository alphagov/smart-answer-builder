#Smart answer builder

This is a tool to build simple 'smart answers' for GOV.UK.

Example smart answer: www.gov.uk/exchange-a-foreign-driving-licence

## What is a 'simple' smart answer?

* Multiple choice questions forming a decision tree
* You can branch/merge the decision tree, but loops aren't allowed
* No variables stored
* No calculations

## Project status

* This is a frontend prototype, not a working product.
* The page generates a JSON representation of the smart answer.
* We're building something which can render JSON into a smart answer â€“ watch this space.
